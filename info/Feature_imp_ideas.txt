Feature importance ideas: 

1) Gain is Invalid
- But having removed the co-located genes from the feature importance output
- Still has a relevant metric 
- Unfortunetly the metric is NOT CONSISTENT (Whenever a model is changed such that it relies more on a feature, then the attributed importance for that feature should not decrease)

2) LOFO 
- Gold-standard
- very consistent
- likely a very good interpretability and accuracy
- Highly intensive as involves retraining while leaving out each feature in an interative manner
- Might be implementable if interactome genes are reduced to groups based on colinearity (PCA) before training
- Could be used as a validation method after using SHAP of the (top) output gene(s) which would reduce the computational effort needed
- Might also be benefecial to only run on top genes for predictions that exceeded a certian performance score (accuracy, f1, ...)
- High LOFO means the loss of that feature was detremental
- Very costly (computational and time)
- Interactions between features is not really an issue

3) SHAP
- easier than LOFO
- can be individualised (broken down to each smaple)
- can use first and follow up on top results with LOFO

4) Permutation Importance
- consistent
- Faster than LOFO (no retraining needed)
- sensitive to interactions and colinearity of the features (need to cluster genes prior to running)


5) The UGT is not a sound metric
- has not been normalised (sum of gains > 1)
- Even normalising each gene gain does nothing to mitigate the biased nature of how Gain is assessed
