- Downlaoding and loading the data adn scripts onto local machine
- Going to look at the following cancer types: 
    - Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
    - Lung Adenocarcinoma
    - Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma
    - Breast Invasive Carcinoma

- Reading up on the interpretable metrics for ML models
- Want to know if SHAP is a good alternative to the Gain metrics

- Need to remove the genes that show up as the top contributor for target aberrant features already related to that gene
- If the gene is located on a chromosome arm that is lost then it's importance is nonsensical
- However this brings up if the training data should be edited in some fashion to prevent training with genes linked to the target feature
- To remove the genes from the feature importance graph that are located on the same target feature, I need: 
	- To create/download df with genomic position of each gene in the full interactome
	- Gene, Chromosome & Arm as columns
	- For each feature importance results csv file (56), reduce the results to only include genes that are not on that feaures

- Reading up on the SHAP values
- On interpretable AI methods
- Several metrics can be used to assess the feautre importance (Gain/Gini, Cover, LOFO, Permutation importance, SHAP...) but should be selected based on their consistency 
- Coming up with a plan to best interpret the gene importances
- Thinking about using a fast but comprehensive method (TreeSHAP)followed up with a validation of the results using a deeper method (LOFO) 
- Clustering colinear genes prior to the training of the model might still be beneficial in increasing the runspeed, also remving colinear affects can enable the use of Permuation importance instead of LOFO

05/06/25
- Wrote note word doc (XGBoost Feature Importance Metrics) on the Feature importance metrics and their advantages and disadvantages in terms of the project
- Downlaoding the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.114.chr.gtf.gz to use as the gene annotation df
- Created the df for referencing the genes and their chromosome location 
- Created a smaller one for only the genes of interest

06/06/25
- Finished looping over the different cancer types and base layer feature importance results removing genes which are located on the same chromosome for aneuploidy target features
- Need to combine the results from all Targets into a single df
- Have been doing this only for the aneuploid features but could still need to implement in some manner on the percentromeric cnvs
- For the peri cnv feature importance modifications, could remove all genes on the chromosome (seems excessive), remove genes that are close to /wihtin the pericentromeric range 

10/06/25
- Need to edit the gene reduction to only include genes that are one the same chromosome arm
- Will do the same for pericentromeric CNVs 

11/06/25
- Find the centromeric position of each chromosome or find gtf gene annotaion file that contains the chromosome arm annotation too

12/06/25
- Downloaded the centromeric positions from: https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/
- the file that was used was: https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/centromeres.txt.gz
- Need to combine the gene_annotation gtf and query it with the centromere annotation df to label genes to their corresponding arm

16/06/25
- Added the chromosome arm labels to the gene annotation file for the referencing
- Edited the Genomic_importance_mod.RMD script to integrate this new df into the pipeline so that it is able to identify the genes from the same chr & arm as the Target feature and remove them from the feat importance heatmap
- Produce teh visualisations for the modified resutls
- Think about how to incorporate this tactic for the pericentromeric CNVs

17/06/25
- by removing cis genes that appear on the same features, we are losign the ability to identify cis-drivers of the target feature
- Could break the output down into 2 heatmaps per feature:
	- one with all genes 
	- one with only trans acting genes (no genes from teh same target feature)
- Might be best to leave teh genes for the pericentromeric cnv features since few genes will show up within the genomic window and any that do would be mechanistically interesting
- Finished the edit for the genomic feature importance script
- Need to edit the interaction feature importance to exclude the a self-assingment where the most important base learner is teh same as the meta learner

18/06/25
- Don't need to edit the interaction plot or script since all interactions are already displayed by the plot
- Reasoning for cis-gene exclusion strategy :
		"We kept all genes—including those on the target arm—inside each arm-aneuploidy learner during training, but we hide the same-arm (“cis”) genes when we visualise feature importance. This compromise preserves the classifier’s best-possible accuracy (because the model can still exploit the strong expression-dosage signal of cis genes) while preventing a circular interpretation that merely restates the copy-number event. The trade-off is clear: by anchoring the model on highly predictive cis features we inevitably down-weight trans-acting genes in the raw Gain / SHAP distribution, so the trans-only importance heatmap can look muted. Had we removed cis genes at training time we would likely recover bolder trans-acting importances, but at the cost of poorer overall performance and a departure from the baseline model we compare throughout the bottom-up workflow. Thus, masking at interpretation gives a defensible balance between interpretability and robustness, and any residual under-representation of trans effects is made explicit rather than silently baked into weaker models."
- Fitlered out the cis-genes from the heatmaps 

19/06/25
- Finding genes that differ or remain between the filtered vs unfiltered genomic importance outputs
- Focusing on the genes that remain (for the aneuploid target features obviously)
- In BRCA, the 4p target feature shows the same contributing gene between the filtered and unfiltered sets SUV39H2
- Looking through the lit there does not seem to be a known connection between SUV39H2 and chromsome 4p 
- SUV39H2 is genomically located on 10p
- Target feature 4p retains the same top gene across all 4 cancer types 
- 4p also shows somewhat of a low accuracy across all 4 cancer types 


20/06/25
- Metting with adi about the findings and new changes
- From the meeting: 
	- Add the whole chromosome exclusion as well as the chromosome arm exclusion
	- filter the pancan genomic importance
	- implement the shapley values
	- change the heatmaps to breakdown by type (aneuploidy features, pericentromeric cnv features, hrd scores)
	- Edit the gradient for the self features in the meta interactions heatmap
	- Think about the use of DL learners in the model 
	- Think and read about a Generative model that can make predictions about KO genes 
- Need to find the files for the general PANCAN model on the Mac
- Not in the project/Janssen/chromatin_cancer folder
